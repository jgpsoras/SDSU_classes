# SDSU_classes

This Jupyter notebook uses Python and SQLite to take an excel file of a list of Mechanical Engineering classes at SDSU, and creates an SQL database which has separate tables for each instance of Class, Location, and Time, and links them all together in an overall Schedule table. The database is then queried with various requests.

The excel file is in the Github repository. Data source: https://sunspot.sdsu.edu/schedule/search?mode=search&abbrev=M%20E
